#' Shiny User Interfaces and Customizations Using Pixiedust  
#' 
#' The initial motivation behind \code{shinydust} was that I needed a way to have a table 
#' of options in a shiny application that included the radio buttons to select a record.
#' After selecting a record, I would explore the data behind that record in more detail in
#' subsequent tabs.  As I explored how to make this happen, I discovered--to my delight--that
#' all of the work I had previously put into \code{pixiedust} could be applied to this 
#' table and other styles of tabular shiny inputs.
#' 
#' The tools in \code{shinydust} provide the ability to produce tabular panels that have
#' all the reactivity of \code{controls} and all of the flexibility of \code{pixiedust}
#' tables.
